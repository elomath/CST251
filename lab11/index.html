			<h2> Problems </h2>
			<p> I've been struggling to seperate my css file link from my image. I was editing the image in inspect element and changing it there but I don't know where to put it in my code. Additionally, I dont know how to link the css file to the webpage; I'm not sure if Wes want me to link it to a screenshot of the code or?</p>
		<div id="Results"> </div>
			<h2> Results </h2>
