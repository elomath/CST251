  <h2> Problems </h2>
  	<p> I struggled to find a starting point to start editing the css file. I was confused on what exactly did what and what chanegs would affect the webpage </p>
  <div> </div>
      <div id = Results class = writeup-section>
  <h2> Results </h2>
  	<p> To solve these problems, I copied the css file we used last class and starting altering values. I tested what adjusted each part of the webpage and it helped me understand what was going on. I'm not 100 percent confident in css styling yet but I think I'm a bit more comfortabel with it.  </p>
